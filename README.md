# kezplez-nx
### Now with 100% more keys!!
## The "easiest" way to get all 70+ Nintendo Switch keys to use with hactool!

## Usage
YOU MUST HAVE DUMPED YOUR FUSES AND TSEC_KEYS BEFORE USING THIS.

1. Launch CTCaer's hekate mod (must be version v4.0+), and dump your fuses (not kfuses!) and tsec_keys by going through the menu
* For fuses, Console Info -> Print fuse info -> Press power button
* For tsec_keys, Console Info -> Print TSEC keys -> Press power button
### IF YOU ARE ON 1.0.0 - 2.3.0, ALSO DO THE FOLLOWING IN HEKATE:
* Tools -> Backup -> Backup eMMC BOOT0/1
* Tools -> Dump package1/2

2. Launch CFW so you can access homebrew

3. Via FTPD, Appstore-nx, or some other method of getting files on your switch, put `kezplez-nx.nro` and `kezplez-nx.nacp` in "/switch/kezplez-nx" on your sd card.

4. Launch it, read the information presented, and press A to have the magic happen

Keys will appear at "/keys.txt" on your sd card. In the future, there may be features such as uploading keys to a site like pastebin.com for convenience or a payload version of this application so you can run it in RCM.
